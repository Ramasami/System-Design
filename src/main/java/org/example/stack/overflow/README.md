# Project Overview

This project is a Java-based simulation of a Q&A platform (similar to StackOverflow), demonstrating clean object-oriented design and separation of concerns.

## ðŸ“‚ Packages & Structure

- **manager/** â€” Contains classes that coordinate high-level operations and handle core application logic.
- **model/** â€” Holds entity/model classes representing the domain objects (e.g., `User`, `Question`, `Answer`, `Tag`, `Vote`, `Reputation`).
- **service/** â€” Contains service classes encapsulating business logic (e.g., `UserService`, `QuestionService`, `AnswerService`, `VoteService`, etc.).
- **StackOverFlowApplication.java** â€” The main entry point that initializes the system and wires components together.

## ðŸŽ¯ Design Patterns Used

1. **MVC-inspired separation**
    - **Model** layer: `model/` package
    - **Service/Controller-like** layer: `service/` package
    - **Manager** layer acts as an orchestrator for complex workflows.

2. **Service Layer Pattern**
    - Business logic is encapsulated in service classes, making it reusable and easy to test.
    - Example: `QuestionService` handles all question-related operations.

3. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - Each class is focused on a single responsibility (e.g., `UserService` only manages users).

4. **Dependency Injection (Manual)**
    - Instead of creating dependencies internally, classes receive them via constructors or setters (simplifying testing and flexibility).

5. **Enum-based Strategy** (for certain constants and types)
    - For example, `VoteType` and `ReputationType` enums define fixed strategies for behavior classification.

6. **Composition over Inheritance**
    - Many relationships use object references instead of deep inheritance, improving flexibility.

## ðŸ›  Technical Details

- **Language:** Java (JDK 17 compatible)
- **Architecture:** Layered, modular design
- **Entities (Models):**
    - `User`, `Question`, `Answer`, `Comment`, `Tag`, `Vote`, `Reputation`
- **Services:**
    - Handle business rules and interact with entities.
    - Example: `VoteService` updates `Reputation` when a vote is cast.
- **Managers:**
    - Coordinate multiple services for higher-level features.

## âœ… Advantages of This Design

- **High Maintainability** â€” Code is organized by responsibility, making it easier to modify.
- **Testability** â€” Business logic is in isolated service classes, simplifying unit testing.
- **Extensibility** â€” New featu


## ðŸ”’ Thread Safety Considerations

This codebase **does not implement explicit thread-safety mechanisms** such as synchronization, locks, or concurrent data structures.  
Key points to note:

1. **Single-threaded assumption**
    - The current design appears to be intended for sequential execution.
    - No background threads, worker pools, or async calls are used.

2. **Mutable State**
    - Many model objects (`User`, `Question`, `Answer`, etc.) have public setter methods and are mutable.
    - If shared between threads without synchronization, this could lead to race conditions or inconsistent state.

3. **Service Classes**
    - Services hold no internal mutable state beyond the objects they manage.
    - However, if multiple threads share the same service instance and mutate shared objects, concurrency issues may occur.

4. **Collections**
    - If `List`, `Map`, or `Set` instances are used internally, they are most likely `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc., which are **not** thread-safe.
    - If concurrent access is expected, consider using `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, or explicit synchronization.

### ðŸ“Œ Recommendations for Thread Safety
If you plan to make this system multi-threaded:
- **Immutability** â€” Make model classes immutable where possible.
- **Synchronization** â€” Use `synchronized` blocks/methods or `java.util.concurrent` locks when modifying shared state.
- **Thread-safe collections** â€” Replace non-thread-safe collections with concurrent equivalents.
- **Stateless services** â€” Ensure services remain stateless or manage state in a thread-safe manner.
- **Testing** â€” Add concurrency tests to detect race conditions.

Currently, in its default form, this project is **not safe for concurrent modification** without additional safeguards.
