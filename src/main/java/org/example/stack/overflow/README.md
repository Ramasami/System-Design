# StackOverflow-Style Module — Design Overview

This module models the core domain and application logic of a Q&A platform (akin to StackOverflow). The goal is to present a clean separation of concerns, readable domain models, and service orchestration that make the system easy to understand, test, and extend.

---

## Objectives

- Model the essential concepts: Users, Questions, Answers, Comments, Tags, Votes, and Reputation.
- Encapsulate business rules in a service layer with clear responsibilities.
- Provide a facade/orchestrator that exposes a cohesive API for higher-level workflows.
- Keep the design storage-agnostic so persistence can be added later without large refactors.

---

## Architecture at a Glance

- Manager/Facade
  - Orchestrates multi-entity workflows and exposes a simple entry point for clients.
- Services
  - Encapsulate business rules, validations, and operations for specific domain areas.
- Domain Models
  - Represent the core entities and value types used throughout the system.

A Mermaid class diagram describing the structure is available in `design.mmd`.

## Key Components

1. Manager (Facade)
   - Acts as an application-facing API that coordinates calls across services.
   - Provides a single place to apply cross-cutting validations and compose operations (e.g., ask question, answer, vote).

2. Services
   - UserService: user creation, retrieval, reputation lookup, and user-related validations.
   - QuestionService: question creation, tagging, answer association, author checks, and content validation.
   - AnswerService: answer creation, association to a question, acceptance rules, and content validation.
   - CommentService: add/get comments with ID and content validations.
   - TagService: tag creation/retrieval with ID/name validation.
   - VoteService: vote registration/removal and vote count calculations for questions/answers.
   - ReputationService: updates a user’s reputation based on events (votes, accepted answers, participation).

3. Domain Models
   - User, Reputation
   - Question, Answer, Comment, Tag
   - Vote (with type and target)
   - Enums for stable classifications (e.g., vote type, reputation event types)

---

## Core Design Principles

- Separation of Concerns
  - Domain models are free of orchestration logic.
  - Services own business rules and validations.
  - The manager/facade composes multi-step workflows across services.

- Explicit Validations
  - ID and content validations are performed at service boundaries.
  - Early failure (“fail fast”) prevents invalid state from propagating.

- Composition over Inheritance
  - Entities reference each other through identifiers or direct associations rather than deep hierarchies.

- Testability
  - Services are structured for straightforward unit testing.
  - Facade flows can be covered by integration-style tests with stubbed services if needed.

---

## Key Use Cases and Flows

1. Create a User
   - Validate username.
   - Instantiate user with an initial reputation.
   - Return the created user.

2. Ask a Question
   - Validate author ID and content.
   - Create question; associate it with the author.
   - Optionally attach tags.

3. Answer a Question
   - Validate author ID, question ID, and content.
   - Create the answer and associate it with the question.

4. Comment on an Answer
   - Validate author ID, answer ID, and content.
   - Create and attach the comment to the answer.

5. Vote on Question/Answer
   - Validate voter ID and target ID.
   - Register up/down vote and update vote counts.
   - Adjust reputation as per voting rules.

6. Accept an Answer
   - Validate that the caller is the question’s author.
   - Mark the answer as accepted.
   - Apply reputation changes.

---

## Reputation and Voting Rules

Typical rule set supported by the services (tunable as needed):
- Upvote on an answer increases the answerer’s reputation.
- Upvote on a question increases the asker’s reputation.
- Downvotes may decrease both the content author’s reputation and possibly charge a small penalty to the voter.
- Accepted answer grants additional reputation to the answerer.
- Asking and answering can be tracked for aggregate metrics.

The ReputationService centralizes reputation updates to ensure a single source of truth.

---

## Validation Strategy

- Identity Validation
  - Check that referenced users, questions, answers, comments, and tags exist before acting.

- Content Validation
  - Ensure text fields (e.g., title, body, comment, tag name) are present and meet minimal length constraints.

- Authorization Checks
  - For acceptance of answers, verify that the caller is the question’s author.

- Vote Constraints
  - The same user should not vote multiple times on the same target in the same direction without toggling/removal.
  - Self-voting can be restricted depending on business rules.

---

## Data and Association Model

- User
  - Owns a Reputation object.
  - Can author questions and answers; can comment and vote.

- Question
  - Authored by a user; has answers, comments, votes, and tags.
  - May have exactly one accepted answer at any time.

- Answer
  - Belongs to a question; authored by a user; has comments and votes.
  - Can be accepted by the question’s author.

- Comment
  - Authored by a user; typically attached to an answer (and can be extended for questions).

- Tag
  - Lightweight label associated with one or more questions.

- Vote
  - Cast by a user on either a question or an answer.
  - Encodes direction (up/down) and target.

---

## Error Handling

- Services validate inputs and throw descriptive exceptions on invalid operations.
- The facade can translate service exceptions to higher-level error messages or codes.
- Validation failures occur early to prevent partial or inconsistent writes in multi-step flows.

---

## Concurrency and Consistency

- The default design targets single-threaded usage for simplicity.
- If concurrent access is anticipated:
  - Make entities immutable where possible or synchronize mutations.
  - Use thread-safe collections for shared state.
  - Serialize operations that affect the same aggregates (e.g., voting on the same question) to avoid race conditions.
  - Consider optimistic/pessimistic locking if/when persistence is introduced.

---

## Persistence and Integration (Future-Friendly)

- The module is storage-agnostic. Repositories or DAOs can be introduced later.
- Introducing an API layer (REST/GraphQL) is straightforward:
  - Map requests to facade calls.
  - Translate exceptions to HTTP error responses.
  - Add DTOs for request/response contracts.

---

## Testing Approach

- Unit Tests
  - Validate service-level business rules, including boundary and failure cases.
- Integration Tests
  - Exercise facade flows that span multiple services.
- Property/Scenario Tests
  - Validate complex interactions like vote toggling, accepted answer transitions, and reputation edge cases.

---

## Extensibility

- Badges and Achievements
  - Hook into ReputationService or a domain event bus for milestone tracking.
- Moderation and Flags
  - Add moderation entities and services with role-based permissions.
- Search and Discovery
  - Introduce indexing and pagination for questions and tags.
- Audit Trail
  - Track changes with immutable event logs for accountability.

---

## Why This Design?

- Clarity: Business logic is discoverable in the corresponding service.
- Flexibility: The facade coordinates services without overloading domain objects.
- Maintainability: Adding features typically means new services or extending existing ones with minimal ripple effects.
- Testability: Each layer is test-friendly, reducing coupling and easing validation of complex flows.
